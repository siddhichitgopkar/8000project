**Title: The Scrolling Epidemic: Reclaiming Our Lives with a Digital Detox**

**Introduction:**
Ladies and gentlemen, have you ever found yourself aimlessly scrolling through your phone, lost in an endless feed of content, only to look up and realize hours have slipped away? You're not alone. 
Today, I want to talk about the scrolling epidemic and how a digital detox can change our lives. I’ll share a personal experiment where I, along with three friends, challenged ourselves to limit our 
scrolling time to just one hour a day. We aimed to understand the impact of this change from both objective and subjective standpoints.

**The Irony:**
Before diving into our findings, let me share a bit about myself. I’m Jiya Patel, a Computer Science major and a graduate student specializing in Cybersecurity. My entire career revolves around 
technology and screens. I live and breathe digital environments, working to protect individuals and organizations from cyber threats. It’s ironic, isn’t it? Here I am, advocating for a digital detox 
while my professional life is deeply entrenched in the digital world. But it is precisely this immersion that prompted me to explore the effects of excessive screen time and seek a balance.

**The Problem:**
In our hyper-connected world, smartphones have become indispensable. They offer convenience, entertainment, and a sense of connection. However, the constant barrage of notifications and the infinite 
scroll can lead to a compulsive habit, often leaving us feeling drained and unproductive. Studies have shown that the average person spends over three hours a day on their phone, much of it spent on 
social media. This phenomenon has sparked concerns about its impact on our mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.

**The Experiment:**
To understand this better, I decided to conduct a month-long experiment. I, along with three friends – let's call them Sarah, David, and Maya – committed to reducing our daily screen time to just 
one hour. We tracked our progress using screen time monitoring apps and documented our experiences through journals.

**Objective Standpoint:**
1. **Productivity:** We measured productivity by tracking the number of tasks completed each day. Before the experiment, we averaged about 60-70% task completion. By the end of the month, our 
productivity had increased to 85-90%. We found that without the constant distraction of our phones, we were able to focus better and complete tasks more efficiently.

2. **Sleep Quality:** Using sleep tracking apps, we monitored our sleep patterns. All of us reported significant improvements in sleep quality. The average increase in sleep duration was about 45 
minutes per night. Better sleep led to improved mood, cognitive function, and overall health.

3. **Physical Activity:** We also tracked our physical activity levels. On average, we saw a 20% increase in the number of steps taken per day. Without the temptation to scroll, we found ourselves 
more inclined to go for walks, exercise, and engage in physical activities.

**Subjective Standpoint:**
1. **Mental Health:** Sarah reported feeling less anxious and more present in her daily life. David noticed a decrease in feelings of loneliness and found himself more engaged in face-to-face 
interactions. Maya, who often struggled with negative self-comparison on social media, experienced a boost in self-esteem and a more positive self-image.

2. **Relationships:** All of us noticed a significant improvement in our relationships. Without the constant distraction of our phones, we had more meaningful conversations and spent more quality 
time with our loved ones. David even mentioned that he felt more connected to his partner than he had in years.

3. **Hobbies and Passions:** Freeing up time previously spent scrolling allowed us to rediscover our hobbies. Sarah started painting again, David picked up playing the guitar, and Maya rekindled her 
love for reading. Personally, I found more time to crochet and read, activities that brought me immense joy and satisfaction.

**Challenges and Negatives:**
However, the journey wasn’t without its challenges. Initially, we all struggled with the urge to check our phones. The first week was particularly tough, as we felt disconnected and even bored at 
times. There were also moments of missing out on social updates and feeling out of the loop. But as the month progressed, these feelings diminished, and we started to appreciate the benefits of our 
digital detox.

**Conclusion:**
This experiment taught us that while technology is a powerful tool, it’s essential to use it mindfully. By reducing our screen time, we reclaimed valuable hours, improved our productivity, and 
enriched our lives. The scrolling epidemic is real, but with conscious effort, we can break free from its grip.

I challenge each of you to try a digital detox. Start small, maybe just an hour less each day, and observe the changes it brings. Reconnect with yourself, your passions, and the people around you. 
Together, let's take back control of our time and our lives.

Thank you.
