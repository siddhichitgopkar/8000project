what is my intention for being in my graduate program + reviewing the grad school website + any 
important dates and forms for the grad program that we are in

My intention for being in my graduate prgram (cyberseurity) is to learn more about a specific 
area within my field. I started it because my regular CS Classes were cool, but they weren't 
super in depth and weren't hitting the points that I was interested in. Right when we would 
broach a subject that I was truly interested in, they would stop at the surface level. I also 
am very interested in getting a job in the cybersecurity department, and unfortunately, 
software engineering in cyber security requires a lot of experience, which nobody wants to give 
you to start out with. I was hoping that getting a master sin cyber security will allow me to 
get a step in to a cybersecurity job, which will give me the experience that I need in order to 
get a job where I can create defense mechanisms and attacks. I want to start out with some 
penetration testing which is pretty simple and that I can teach myself, but there are things 
that I just can't teach myself that I need to know in order to be a good cyber engineer. 

I also want to learn more about cybersecurity because I have thought about law school, but I 
love coding and technical work, so I was thinking about cyber law. This is pretty unlikely 
though because it means I wouldn't be coding and i would rather code than argue with a bunch of 
people all day and read some nonsensical contracts.
