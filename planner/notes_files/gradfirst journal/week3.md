My personal and professional goals are -> to learn as much as i can through this masters 
program and then be able to apply it to my work that i do
This goal is important to me becuase -> its something thats been important to me since I was a 
kid - i think getting a good education is something that is very important to me, and so 
getting this masters and learning as much as i can from my year here is something that I want 
to make sure I do The resources I need to achieve this goal are -> support from my professors 
to be able to 
learn everything that I wnant to be able to learn by the end of the year and before I graduate


jackson's activity helped me refresh my mind and feel more energized - i know the purspoe of 
the exercise was to feel relaxed, and it did that but it also made me more alert and allowed 
me to completely reset my thourghts and have a clear head.

alberto's ativity made me relax a lot more and was a lot more useful to helping me completely 
relax my entire body - its definetely something that i want to try when im trying to go to 
scleep becuase insomnia is something that i struggle with a lot after ive just finished 
studying for a long time. i tend to get a high from completing my assignments and stuff and 
the breathing exercises help me relax so i might try tat when trying to go to bed.
