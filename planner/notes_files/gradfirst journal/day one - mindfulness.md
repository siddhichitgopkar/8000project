Day One Grad First Class:

I got an introduction to the class and breathing exercises during class. I never really paid attention to my breathing patterns or where I carry tnesion before the class. Towards the end of class, we got an introduction to breathing exercises we can use to alleviate 
tension and figure out where we are carrying it. The breathing exercises helped me ground myself and figure out where the tension is coming from. This was useful becuase I can focus on staying less tense going forward and notice more about my breathing and tension 
patterns, which will help to alleviate some of the stress that I have and help me in my daily life.
